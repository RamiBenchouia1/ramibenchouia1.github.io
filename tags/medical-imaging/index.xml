        <description>Intro I was looking at something the other day that referenced a few different kinds of high-tech medical imaging technologies, and got to thinking about how there are quite a few different kinds of imaging machinery and technologies used these days, and it wasnâ€™t entirely clear to me what the difference is between them and in what sorts of situations they are used in medicine. So I wanted to clarify that for myself, and try to produce an easy guide for others who might have had the same question.</description>
