        <description>Intro Hello and welcome! There is a growing body of research that suggests that listening to Mozart can serve as a non-invasive and non-pharmacological intervention for people suffering from intractable epilepsy (aka refractory epilepsy, aka drug-resistant epilepsy). Trouble is, scientists don’t really know how or why this happens. And if there’s two words in the english language that researchers love most, its how and why. So today, we’ll be diving into some fascinating research coming out of Dartmouth that’s just been published in Nature Scientific Reports thats minding and bridging this gap in our understanding.</description>

        <description>Intro I was looking at something the other day that referenced a few different kinds of high-tech medical imaging technologies, and got to thinking about how there are quite a few different kinds of imaging machinery and technologies used these days, and it wasn’t entirely clear to me what the difference is between them and in what sorts of situations they are used in medicine. So I wanted to clarify that for myself, and try to produce an easy guide for others who might have had the same question.</description>

        <description>“… At first Senseless as beasts I gave men sense, Possessed them of mind… In the beginning, seeing, they saw amiss, And hearing, heard not, but like phantoms huddled In dreams, the perplexed story of their days confounded…&amp;quot; Aeschylus, “Prometheus Bound”
“Man permits himself to be deceived in his dreams every night of his life” Nietzsche “On Truth and Lies in the Extramoral sense”
“A man dreamed… and when he awoke he went to his soothsayer and desired that his dream be made plain unto him.</description>

        <description>Exordium A Financial Times article1 from June 14, 2021 titled “Algeria on the brink as pandemic and low oil price take their toll” caught my eye the other day. As I read on, I was struck by a sense of uneasiness both at the implications of the article and at my ignorance regarding the history and trajectory of the country. And thus came the impetus for the text that follows.</description>
