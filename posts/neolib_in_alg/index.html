  <h2 id="exordium"><a class="anchor" href="#exordium" title='Anchor for "Exordium".'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#hashtag"/></svg></a> Exordium</h2> 

<p>A Financial Times article<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> from June 14, 2021 titled “Algeria on the brink as pandemic and low oil price take their toll” caught my eye the other day. As I read on, I was struck by a sense of uneasiness both at the implications of the article and at my ignorance regarding the history and trajectory of the country. And thus came the impetus for the text that follows. I have attempted to gain an understanding of the issue, its causes, and potential future directions, and to communicate this information as simply as possible to anyone interested in the topic.</p>
<p>I imagine that it is not entirely uncommon<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> to find a Western financial news publication hinting at the neoliberalization of a wavering country’s economy, and indeed, this seems to be the case in the aforementioned article. To be clear, the article takes no explicit stance on the ‘best’ way to go forward for the country and seems to be of a more expository ilk rather than a persuasive one. It primarily, and quite succinctly<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, describes the current state of the country’s economy – with a vague account of the contributing factors that begot the country&rsquo;s current economic malaise – and on the whole gives the impression that Algeria’s prognosis is quite poor, in every sense of the word. The article focuses on the government’s reluctance to “introduce reforms that would unshackle the private sector, incentivize investments and bring transparency to an economic system built on a web of vested interests”, highlighting Algeria’s rampant clientelism and “crony capitalism”.</p>
<p>Given the article&rsquo;s cursory nature, one would be remiss to expect from it any semblance of nuance regarding an account of a nuanced or detailed account of how Algeria got to the position it is in, or what realistic solutions it has – and avenues it is likely to take – to preempt its impending economic demise. It is my hope that the discourse that follows has retained a semblance of fidelity to my original aim to reconcile these criticisms of the article, however I do not presume to pretend that I am some historian, economist, or political scientist. And so I hope you’ll proceed with that disclaimer in mind; in any case, let the prevarication cease and, as the King of Hearts advises in Carroll&rsquo;s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, let us “begin at the beginning”.</p>





  <h2 id="the-sick-man-of-africa"><a class="anchor" href="#the-sick-man-of-africa" title='Anchor for "The Sick Man of Africa".'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#hashtag"/></svg></a> The Sick Man of Africa</h2> 

<p>For Algeria, as for so many other countries in North Africa and the Near East, the problem seems to lie primarily in two domains: political entrenchment and economic mismanagement (which all too often seem to go hand-in-hand).</p>
<p>Though the entangled reticulum of history cannot be unwoven without destroying it – delicate thing that it is – and insofar as practicality may justifiably supersede diligence for the task at hand, it will be useful to start our brief historical journey off in the year 1962. This was the year Algeria  – via the National Liberation Front (FLN<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>), the politico-military party that spearheaded the independence struggle – gained independence from its French imperial colonizers. Thereafter, the FLN quickly bureaucratized and consolidated its competing factions under Houari Boumediene in 1965.</p>
<p>Boumediene implemented thoroughly socialist policies<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> which elevated many out of poverty and created a burgeoning public sector. Given the indomitable unity of the Algerian people behind the entity which helped its people realize their independence, Algeria adopted a one-party system under the FLN party from its inception and as time went on, the various faculties of state (military, government, economy, etc.) became interwoven under the auspices of its political system as such. And, alas, therein lies Algeria’s original sin, for this very unilaterality and consolidation of a party which originated as a revolutionary entity, set Algeria up to become what is today, grosso modo<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, a praetorian state. Algeria’s military, whose origins are found in the FLN, is the vehicle through which governing and politics are conducted. In any case, the relative stability and prosperity that Algerian’s experienced under Boumediene was short-lived. Rather than ushering in democratic political – or liberal economic<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> – reforms, the power vacuum left in the wake of Boumediene’s untimely death in 1978 and the oil price collapse in the 1980s, instead revitalized the military’s hold on politics and fueled social discord.</p>
<p>Despite its predilection for military control, it would be inaccurate to claim that Algeria never experimented with democracy. The first open and competitive elections that Algerian’s saw came in 1991. Parliamentary elections were held on December 26, 1991; but before all 430 seats to the People’s National Assembly<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> were decided, a military coup<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> brought the election proceedings to a halt in January of 1992 as the results suggested the Islamist Party (the Islamic Salvation Front, or FIS<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>) was poised to defeat the ruling FLN party<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> which was not in much of a sharing mood given its position of power for the past 30 years, democracy be damned. What followed was a “dark decade”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> marred by a sanguinary civil war between various Islamist groups and the Algerian government which extinguished countless thousands of Algerian lives and any hopes for democracy in Algeria.</p>
<p>Eventually, the FIS was relegated to impotence, and various Islamist guerrilla groups –– the two most prominent being the Islamic Armed Movement (MIA) and the more hard-line Armed Islamic Group (GIA<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>)<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> –– took up fighting against the state. But the fighting was not directed at the state alone. After spending some time in time-out, the FIS managed to parley its way into some negotiations with the government<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> and, in response, the hard-line GIA declared war on the FIS and led a campaign of brutal civilian massacres to root out any grassroots support for government sympathizers. Democratic “elections of hope”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> were held in Algeria once again in 1995, this time for the office of the presidency, which resulted in a victory for (surprise, surprise) the army’s “independent” candidate, General Liamine Zéroual. This led to further infighting and killing amongst the Islamist factions and a perpetuation of their hostilities with the state. By 1997, it became clear the fractured Islamist resistance –– and its zero-tolerance policy for government or competing faction sympathizers, often targeting civilians –– had lost popular support, and that same year, parliamentary elections were won by a newly created (surprise, surprise) pro-army  party supporting Mr. Zéroual. At the end of Zéroual’s term in 1999, presidential elections were again held, and concomitantly Abdelaziz Bouteflika ascended to power, and the FLN alas found its way home to the helm of the “People&rsquo;s Democratic Republic of Algeria”.</p>
<p>The Bouteflika administration swiftly restored order as vast swathes of the Islamists took advantage of an amnesty law he had implemented, and with it he forgave them their debts. Any who were too supercilious to take advantage of this carte blanche were hunted down, and eventually dissidents had been largely silenced or had disappeared by 2002. This large-scale effort of de-islamization of the political terrain, as well as a number of regional instabilities, ended up bestowing the military with a steady flow of state funding. Military expenditure in 2019 was ($USD) 10.3 billion, about 6% of GDP for that year<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The aughts and 2010s went on relatively inconspicuously as Algeria experienced an incongruous state of relative stability given the sociopolitical maelstrom that engulfed North Africa and the Middle East at the time<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. But the FLN pushed their luck a bit too far when they decided to run Mr. Bouteflika for a fifth, yes 5th, term<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> even after a two-term limit statute was reinstated in the 2016 constitutional amendments<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Moreover, this was after he had suffered – and this is the real kicker – a debilitating (as in literally incapacitating) stroke. Yes, that&rsquo;s right folks, in 2019 the Algerian government, out of its infinite wisdom and abounding political foresight, decided to re-run a president who had already served for 20 years and who had been unable to address the public or carry out any state function since his stroke in 2013, for yet another 5 year term. If it was not entirely obvious from the confounding information just recounted: given that the election year was 2019 and given that Algeria has 5 year terms, the prior election was in 2014, so yes indeed, folks, Mr. Bouteflika had already won the previous election in 2014 <em>after</em> his stroke, so I suppose those who made the decision to run him again figured, “eh what the hell, they voted for him last time…”. It started to look like Algeria (the largest country in Africa by surface area, and a country which had accomplished what few other colonized countries had, and expelled its foreign invaders by force and good ‘ole guerrilla gusto) and Mr. Bouteflika (once a fighter in the struggle that cleansed Algeria of its French colonial rule) were becoming “the sick man of Africa”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. I suppose the old adage<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>, best put by our fearless leader, and definitely not war-criminal, George W. Bush<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>, rang true for the Algerian people as they took to the streets at the news of yet another mandate for the Bouteflika administration. Mired by unemployment, decreased purchasing power, and debilitating inflation, the Algerian people took to the streets to voice their vexation. As Frederick Douglass eloquently and simply put it, “power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.” So, that’s it right? The Algerian people’s resounding voice reverberated their message in the tympanic membranes of the political elite who heeded the message and effectuated the denouement of Algeria’s political strife? Right? Yeah… right. What really happened was the election of Mr. Abdelmadjid Tebboune, a former prime minister under Bouteflika, to office in an election with a 41% turnout rate. The more things change, the more they stay the same, eh?</p>
<p>Now that we’ve gotten an idea of the political entrenchment that predicated Algeria’s current issues, let’s briefly discuss the nature and extent of economic mismanagement that has beset Algeria.</p>
<p>Algeria’s economy was founded upon a protectionist, Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) model. Algerians misgivings at the thought of foreign involvement are not surprising given the rape, exploitation, and disenfranchisement they had suffered at the hands of France. Algeria’s protectionist propensities are further demonstrated in the fact that it has a relatively low level of Foreign Direct Investment Net Inflow when stacked up against the 21 other Middle Eastern and North African countries<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. The fundamental idea underlying any ISI economic system is that blocking imports and focusing on developing the country’s own industries (aka import substitution) will bolster demand for domestically produced goods and industrialization and therefore the country&rsquo;s economy. Upwards of 400 companies make up Algeria’s ISI economic machinations, the preponderance of which are majority-state owned<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> and not viable for privatization<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, and fall in the hydrocarbon and construction industries.</p>
<p>Algeria’s largely state-run economy is painfully undiversified, relying heavily on the the extraction, production, and exportation of hydrocarbons (industrial processes which are quickly going out of vogue) and evanescing foreign currency coffers. Add to this the multifarious nefarious consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the society and economy, the oil and gas slump of 2014-2016 (and the rather lethargic increase in prices thereafter), a pre-pandemic youth unemployment rate of around 30%<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>, and a liquidity crisis at banks and local companies, and you’re left with an economy running on fumes.</p>
<p>Riccardo Fabiani (North Africa director at the International Crisis Group) prognosticates that the country has at most one to two years to get its shit together, a prediction which would have been more fatalistic had Algeria not had little foreign debt and the rising of oil prices to look forwards to. These latent advantages conferred upon Algeria by its oil-dominated economy and aversion to foreign investment are unfortunately mostly nominal in nature as they are very unlikely to hedge the chance of impending penury and privation. IMF analysts project 2.9% economic growth with the expected rise of oil prices in 2021 which would simply not be enough to balance the budget deficit which is projected to be 18.4% of GDP. The balancing of this budget, they say, is contingent upon the upshot of crude oil prices more than 2x the $72/barrel it was at around the time of the FT article’s publication, to an astonishing, and very improbable, $170/barrel (a price point which it has never reached before<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Speaking of things which were meant to solve real world problems but which ended up having catastrophic side-effects<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>**, **The IMF and World Bank, in all their munificence and magnanimity, have previously dabbled in Algeria’s economy<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Indeed, they extended their sweaty, usurious hand out<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> to Algeria in 1994 in the form of a “Stand-by Arrangement”<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> which resulted in World Bank “Economic Rehabilitation Support”<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> via a $150 million Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) in 1995<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. At the time, Algeria was in dire economic straits, faced with dwindling foreign exchange reserves, falling GDP growth rates, high inflation, issues in sectors such as agriculture and construction, and rising unemployment (almost exactly the same issues it faces today). When there’s something strange in your economy, who you gonna call? Say it with me now… THE IMF/WORLD BANK.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and this is definitely not the case with an SAL. As the loan’s name implies, The World Bank lends a country money in disbursements contingent upon the successful implementation of… well… the adjustment of the country’s economic structure, namely in realms such as macroeconomic policy, regulation, foreign investment, etc. With Algeria’s accession to the 1994 reform program came a departure from its prior macroeconomic policy, and fortunately an average GDP growth of 3.95% from 1995 to 1996. This was short-lived though, as GDP declined in 1997 by 1.1% and there have been (quite reasonable) questions and research into whether the structural adjustment program did its job, as “the amelioration in some economic indicators was actually due to favorable external factors (ie. rising of oil prices in the international markets)<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" title="See footnotes." role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. The loan was paid off in January of 2006.</p>
<p>As was stated a couple paragraphs ago, Algeria experienced a period of relative stability after the start of the new millennium, in no small part due to the liberalization of Algeria’s economy engendered by its dealings with the IMF and World Bank. Interestingly, the closing out of the loan coincided with the Algerian parliament reinstating the maximum 30% privatization share in any oil and gas facility which it had offered in the 90’s, a rate which failed to attract many investors.</p>
